# Retrospect.nvim

Retrospect.nvim is a Neovim plugin that simplifies session management by allowing you to save and recall your recent sessions effortlessly. It presents your saved sessions in a list, ordered by last usage, making it easy to jump back to your work exactly where you left off.

# Features:

* Save your session from anywhere with a single keybinding without having to worry about where to save and what to name the session
* Always have access to all sessions regardless of which directory you open neovim from
* Sessions are sorted by order of usage so your last used session is always on top
* Preserve the order of buffer usage automagically so plugins like Bufferchad.nvim and Telescope's Buffer View (MRU) still show the same order after restart, something that's not possible with the default session management


## Packer Install Instruction

To install Retrospect.nvim using Packer.nvim, add the following line to your Lua configuration:

```lua
use {"mrquantumcodes/retrospect.nvim"}
```



## Setup Instruction

To configure Retrospect.nvim, add the following code to your Lua Neovim configuration:

```lua
local retrospect = require('retrospect')
retrospect.setup({
  saveKey = "<leader>\\", -- The shortcut to save the session, default is leader+backslash(\)
  loadKey = "<leader><BS>", -- The shortcut to load the session
  style = "default", -- or "modern", if you have nui.nvim and dressing.nvim
  auto_buffer_reorder = false -- set to true if you want to retain the buffer order of usage
})
```

You can customize the saveKey, loadKey, style and auto_buffer_reorder options to fit your preferences.


## Usage

To save a session, use:

```lua
retrospect.SaveSession()
```

To load a session, use:

```lua
retrospect.LoadSession()
```

To delete the current session, use:

```lua
retrospect.DeleteSession()
```

Additionally, you can use the command :DelSession inside Neovim to delete the current session.
